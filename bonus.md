## Process Improvements I'd Propose as the First QA Hire

### 1. Create a Clear Testing Process  
Establish a consistent approach to testing new features, including writing test cases and reviewing acceptance criteria before development begins.

### 2. Organize Bug Tracking and Feedback  
Set up a simple system to report, track, and prioritize bugs (e.g., using Jira), and introduce regular meetings to keep the backlog clean and focused.

### 3. Start Automation Testing if Needed  
If thereâ€™s no automation framework in place, begin building one to cover critical user flows. This saves time, reduces repetitive manual testing, and improves efficiency in each release.

## How I Approach Exploratory Testing

1. I start by reviewing any available documentation to understand the intended behavior of the application, then explore the main user flows and look for edge cases.
2. I try unexpected or incorrect inputs to test how the system responds under unusual or invalid conditions.
3. I take notes on bugs, confusing behavior, and areas for improvement as I test.
4. I collaborate with the development team and product owner to align with project requirements, clarify expectations, and ensure the product meets both functional and user needs.
